This is a 2d platformer game, made in Gamemaker studio 2. 
It has 30 day free version so this is as much as I can share. 
Anybody who has this studio can try to play the game and see the code. 
In this game I made 2 NPCs which 1 will heal you and the other one is giving you a quest to kill the boss. After you killed the boss he will display a different message.
The player has 2 options when in contact with enemies: 1. is to attack with shift and 2. is to block attacks holding ctrl. The boss does a lot more damage so he is harder to beat.
All sprites are animated.
